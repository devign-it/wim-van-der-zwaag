# Devign.it - Digital Agency

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7ec1dd00-30a0-4187-8a5b-3453a22e544f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/daanvanderzwaag/deploys)

To highlight personal works from the past years, I’ve created a dynamic website to showcase projects. Next to displaying work, this project taught me more about Gatsby.js, React.js, Serverless Deployments and Continuous Integrations.

## Use this project

Personally, I’ve learnt the most by recreating beautiful digital experiences made by others. That’s why you can use this repo to play around and to learn about the used tools.

-   [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) Javascript framework for building the User Interface (UI)
-   [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) Static Site Generator (SSR) for speed optimisation
-   [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) API based CMS for managing the content
-   [OGL](https://github.com/oframe/ogl) Library for WebGL interactions
-   [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) Javascript animation library for the UI
